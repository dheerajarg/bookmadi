**Javascript**

Use any Javascript design pattern to create a simple dom based library(similar to Jquery) which will be able to perform following tasks:
Change the class name of any dom elements
Get datasets from dom elements
Inject new dom element
Make both ajax and get request
Get and set values from input box/checkbox/select dropdown
Make 3 POST requests at the same time which needs to be resolved all at the same time. 
Assume we have a SPAN element with some texts in it. Create a clipboard copy feature for that SPAN without using any library
Create a very simple two way binding feature



**PHP**

Use this link to get XML data and convert those data in more readable JSON format
We have an array of IDs and prices. Please create two functions as per the below, 
1.     One which will return the lists, which have prices greater than a certain threshold that can be dynamic provided by the user. 

2.     Another function will return the total sum of prices from that filtered list. 

Create/Architect a PHP class which will receive certain defined inputs and connect to database(does not need to connect to db just create a function for connecting DB), class should include helper functions which can be both internal static and external functions and at last class need to provide some output.
Create an action controller which will receive POST request from frontend, need to validate the inputs as defined (like if we should get id and value, check if id is number and value is string), catch the errors if any and return the some outputs in JSON format
